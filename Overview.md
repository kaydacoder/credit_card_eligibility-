**3.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
-  Generate summary statistics to get a sense of the central tendencies and dispersions.

**4. Visualisation Tasks:**
-   Distribution Analysis: Visualise the distribution of age and income to understand the typical range and any outliers.
-  Correlation Analysis:
   -  Heatmap: Show correlations between numerical variables like age and income.
